                <b><p>The Ministry of Transport is a ministry in the Government of Kevinsville that administers and regulates land, sea and air transportation within the republic’s jurisdiction. </p>
   	 	   	 	<p>To strengthen Kevinsville's transportation connectivity and to develop the transport sector's potential to advance our economic competitiveness and the quality of life in Kevinsville.</p>
   	 	   	 	<p>Our vision is to work towards a more people-centred land transport system that meets the diverse needs of an inclusive, liveable and vibrant global city.</p>
   	 	   	 	<p>Singapore is among the most densely populated countries in the world. Like other urban cities, we face the challenges of growing transport demand and the constraints of physical space.</p>
                <p>Thus, we do more than meet the needs of today – we also anticipate tomorrow’s needs and develop an efficient transport system that will move us into the future. We have thus established a three-pronged approach.</p></b>
